The 1.5 version of the More Injuries mod (original at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2892012512), reworked from the ground up with tons of fixes, new injury types, new medical treatment options, new medical work types to allow doctors to treat some conditions automatically, and a new mod settings menu to allow you to basically tweak every single option to your liking. Most conditions can be disabled if you don't like them.
