  <!-- EN: Research into the synthesis of epinephrine, a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in the body's fight-or-flight response. By developing an autoinjector that can deliver a precise dose of epinephrine in emergency situations, you will be able to craft epinephrine autoinjectors that can be used to boost blood pressure and increase heart rate to temporarily reduce the adverse effects of hypovolemic shock and anemia.\n\nWe suspect an additional potential use for this drug as a combat stimulant, but further research is required to confirm its efficacy. -->

  <!-- EN: Unlock the secrets of cellular regeneration, a cutting-edge medical technology that allows for the repair and regrowth of damaged tissues at the cellular level. By using mechanites to stimulate the body's natural healing processes, your doctors will be able to cure injuries that were previously considered untreatable, such as hearing and nerve damage. The same technology is used on glitterworlds to treat paralysis and degenerative diseases, but its application is still experimental and its long-term effects are not yet fully understood. -->
