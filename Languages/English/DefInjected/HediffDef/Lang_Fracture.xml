  <!-- EN: A partial or complete break of a bone caused by trauma, overuse, or disease. The bone may be cracked, splintered, or completely broken into two or more pieces. Until properly treated, the affected limb will be unable to bear weight or move properly, causing severe pain and loss of function. Must either be splinted to immobilize the bone and promote healing over time, or surgically repaired to realign and stabilize the bone, allowing for quick recovery. -->
