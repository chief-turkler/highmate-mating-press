  <!-- EN: A thoracoscope is a specialized medical instrument equipped with a camera and light source, designed for minimally invasive examination and procedures within the chest cavity. It is inserted through a small incision in the chest wall, allowing surgeons to visualize and operate on the lungs, pleura, or other thoracic structures. Thoracoscopes are commonly used in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), such as repairing collapsed lungs or removing diseased tissue. -->
