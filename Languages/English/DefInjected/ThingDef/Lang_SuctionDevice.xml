  <!-- EN: An airway suction device is a medical device used to clear the airway of blood, vomit, or other obstructions that may prevent a patient from breathing properly. It is commonly used in emergency situations, such as when a patient is choking from blood or other fluids, to prevent asphyxiation and death. The hand-operated device uses a vacuum to remove fluids from the airway, allowing the patient to breathe freely and restoring normal respiration. -->
